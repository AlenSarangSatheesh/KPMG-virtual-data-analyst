# KPMG Virtual Data Analyst Internship

This repository contains my submission for **Task 1: Data Quality Assessment** of the KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship (hosted by Forage). 

## Project Overview

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes & cycling accessories organization, has approached KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team for assistance with their marketing strategy. The primary goal is to analyze their datasets to help optimize resource allocation for targeted marketing.

**Task 1** focuses on assessing the quality of the client's data to ensure it is ready for analysis. This involves identifying data quality issues and providing recommendations to mitigate them.

## Repository Structure

* **`Task 1.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used to conduct the data quality assessment. It includes:
    * Loading the datasets (Customer Demographic, Customer Address, and Transactions).
    * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
    * Checks for data accuracy, completeness, consistency, currency, relevancy, validity, and uniqueness.
* **`Email Draft.txt`**: A draft email addressed to the client (Sprocket Central Pty Ltd). This document summarizes the key data quality issues identified during the assessment and outlines strategies to resolve them before moving forward with the analysis.

## Key Findings & Data Quality Issues

* **Completeness:** Identified missing values in key columns that may require imputation or exclusion.
* **Consistency:** Detected inconsistent data types and formatting issues across different tables.
* **Accuracy:** Flagged outliers and potential errors in data entries.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
* NumPy (Numerical computing)
* Jupyter Notebook
